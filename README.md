This is a game called Crystal Collector

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your score goes over the random number.  The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts the values of the crystal are reset to new numbers.

I learned a lot about jQuery and jQueryUI building this game
